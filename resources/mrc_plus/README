The link to the MRC dataset file I used in this work is no longer active.
However, you can find the file at:
https://web.archive.org/web/20160208104821/http://www.psych.rl.ac.uk:80/gl_rate.wds

If you have trouble finding it, email me. I renamed this file as
mrcpd_complete_dataset.wds, so as to clearly distinguish it from the MRC+ data
in the same directory.

Getting the expanded MRC+ data (used to get imageability and some concreteness
scores) is trickier. If you're affiliated with UNT's HiLT Lab, contact me
(Natalie) and I can direct you to our copy. If you're not, you will have to
email the creators of the dataset for access. The person you'll need to contact
is Tomek Strzalkowski: tomek@albany.edu. He'll send you the data along with
information regarding its structure, copyright details, and how to cite it.
