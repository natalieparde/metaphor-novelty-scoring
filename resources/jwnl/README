To use JWNL, you'll need to download the WordNet database files here:
http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/wn3.1.dict.tar.gz

Unpack them, and take note of the path to the dict/ folder. Then, open
properties.xml (in this directory) and scroll down to line 41. Replace
/local2/WordNet-3.0/dict with the path to the dict/ folder on your own
computer.

Remember to cite WordNet if you use it in your own work! You can find
details regarding how to cite it here:
