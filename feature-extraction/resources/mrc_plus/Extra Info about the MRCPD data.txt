Some notes about the MRCPD (from myself, not the authors themselves).

1. Column Names
   Not sure why the columns don't have names in the downloaded file,
   but they correspond to (from left to right):
   0)  Word
   1)  Imagery (Mean)
   2)  Imagery (SD)
   3)  Age of Acquisition (Mean)
   4)  Age of Acquisition (SD)
   5)  Familiarity (Mean)
   6)  Familiarity (SD)
   7)  Concreteness (Mean)
   8)  Concreteness (SD)
   9)  Meaning Uncertainty (also referred to in the paper as Ambiguity)
   10) Thorndike-Lorge (1944) Frequency, where AA is represented by 100 and A by 50
   
2. Rating Scale
   Annotators were given each word along with a 7-point rating scale.  Thus,
   the means for each metric, for each word, range from 1-7.
   
3. Information Source
   All of the information just noted can be found in the following publication:
   KJ Gilhooly and RH Logie. (1980). Age of acquisition, imagery, concreteness, 
   familiarity and ambiguity measures for 1944 words. Behaviour Research Methods 
   and Instrumentation 12, 395-427.
